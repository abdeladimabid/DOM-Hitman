# DOM Sniper — README

**Live demo:** [https://abdeladimabid.github.io/DOM-Hitman/](https://abdeladimabid.github.io/DOM-Hitman/)

## What is this project?

DOM Sniper is an interactive, visually appealing browser game (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that teaches the JavaScript DOM and event concepts by turning code into actions. Players “take the shot” by writing the correct DOM code to select and interact with elements — mastering selectors, class manipulation, event handling, and event propagation — while avoiding innocent elements on the page. The game is level-based with progressive challenges.

---

## Key features

* Level-based gameplay that gradually introduces DOM APIs and patterns. 
* Hands-on exercises: players type JS (selectors, `addEventListener`, stop propagation, class toggling) and see immediate visual feedback.
* Failure states tied to incorrect DOM operations (e.g., hitting innocent elements).
* Visual UI with score, level indicator, and in-play controls (Snipe!, Solution, Next Level, Reset Level).

## How to play (player guide)

* Each level presents a scene with targets and bystanders.
* Your task: write a single correct line (or a short snippet) of JavaScript that selects the correct element(s) and performs the required action.

## Contributing

Love the concept? Great — here are ways to help:

1. Add new levels (more complex DOM trees, nested handlers, real-world UI scenarios).
2. Improve UX/visual polish (animations, mobile responsiveness, sound).
3. Add difficulty tiers and a level editor so users can author challenges.
4. Create tutorial-mode overlays that explain why the correct solution works.
5. Submit PRs with tests for level logic (unit tests for solution validation).
6. Help fix bugs.
